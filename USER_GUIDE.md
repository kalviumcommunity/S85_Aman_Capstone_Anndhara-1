## Troubleshooting

### "I can't access certain pages after signing up"

This is likely because you haven't set your role yet. After logging in, go to your Profile page by clicking on your username or the profile icon in the navigation bar. Then click "Edit Profile", select your role, and save your changes.

### "I created an account but can't log in"

Make sure you're using the exact same email and password you used during sign-up. If you still can't log in, try the following:

1. Check if you're using the correct email address
2. Make sure your password is correct (passwords are case-sensitive)
3. Try clearing your browser cache and cookies
4. If all else fails, create a new account with a different email address

### "I get an error saying 'Email Already is Use' when signing up"

This error occurs when you try to create an account with an email address that is already registered in our system. Instead of creating a new account:

1. Go to the Login page
2. Use the email address and password you previously registered with
3. If you don't remember your password, contact support for assistance

Each email address can only be associated with one account in our system.

### "I logged in with Google but can't access certain features"

After logging in with Google, you still need to set your role. Go to your Profile page by clicking on your username or the profile icon in the navigation bar. Then click "Edit Profile", select your role, and save your changes.
